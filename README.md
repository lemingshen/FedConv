# FedConv: A Learning-on-Model Paradigm for Heterogeneous Federated Clients
Federated Learning (FL) facilitates collaborative training of a shared global model without exposing clientsâ€™ private data. In practical FL systems, clients (e.g., edge servers, smartphones, and wearables) typically have disparate system resources. Conventional FL, however, adopts a one-size-fits-all solution, where a homogeneous large global model is transmitted to and trained on each client, resulting in an overwhelming workload for less capable clients and starvation for other clients. To address this issue, we propose FedConv, a client-friendly FL framework, which minimizes the computation and memory burden on resource-constrained clients by providing heterogeneous customized sub-models. FedConv features a novel learning-on-model paradigm that learns the parameters of the heterogeneous sub-models via convolutional compression. Unlike traditional compression methods, the compressed models in FedConv can be directly trained on clients without decompression. To aggregate the heterogeneous sub-models, we propose transposed convolutional dilation to convert them back to large models with a unified size while retaining personalized information from clients. The compression and dilation processes, transparent to clients, are optimized on the server leveraging a small public dataset. Extensive experiments on six datasets demonstrate that FedConv outperforms state-of-the-art FL systems in terms of model accuracy (by more than 35% on average), computation and communication overhead (with 33% and 25% reduction, respectively).

## FedConv Overview

![System overview of FedConv](images/system.png)

- Server
    - Initialize a large global model.
    - Apply _Convolutional Compression_ on the large global and generate heterogeneous sub-models for clients.
    - Apply _Transposed Convolutional Dilation_ on the received heterogeneous client models to transform them into large models.
    - Apply _Weighted Average Aggregation_ on the rescaled large models and perform model aggregation for the next global communication round.

- Heterogeneous Clients
    - Perform their resource profiles to determine a set of shrinkage ratios and transmit the shrinkage ratios to the server.
    - Perform local training as in traditional FL.

## Quick Start
### 1. Installation
```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu117
```

### 2. PyTorch Package Modification
Replace the following Python files from your local Python environment with the files provided in the `Replace` folder:

```
/usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages/torch/nn/modules/module.py
/usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages/torch/nn/modules/conv.py
/usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages/torch/nn/modules/batchnorm.py
/usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages/torch/nn/modules/linear.py
/usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages/torch/nn/init.py
```

Note that the paths to the above files may vary based on your local Python environment.

### 3. Server Configuration
```bash
python3 server.py
```

### 4. Client Configuration
```bash
python3 client.py --client_id 0
python3 client.py --client_id 1
python3 client.py --client_id 2
...
python3 client.py --client_id 9
```

## Notes
- Feel free to modify the hyper-parameters in the `config.py`
- The default number of clients is 10.
- Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions.
- Due to the limited space, we only uploaded the MNIST dataset to the repository. You can download other datasets from their official websites and use "Dirichlet distribution" to split them.

## Q&A
- grpc connection error
	- Error `grpc_message:"failed to connect to all addresses; last error: UNKNOWN: ipv4:127.0.0.1:8080: Failed to connect to remote host: Connection refused"`
	- Solution
		- When running clients, please modify a variable named `server_address` in `config.py` to the ground truth IP address of your server.
		- Make sure that your server has opened the firewall port `8080` and that no other processes are occupying this port.
